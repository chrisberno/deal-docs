# Deal Docs Strategy & Roadmap

**🔒 PRIVATE - NOT FOR PUBLIC REPO**

Strategic planning document for Deal Docs future development and positioning.

---

## 🎯 Current Position

✅ **What We Have:**
- Self-hosted enterprise dataroom platform
- OKTA OIDC authentication  
- Subscription bypass = unlimited features
- Comprehensive developer documentation
- $50k+/year value proposition (replaces Ansarada, Firmex, Intralinks)

---

## 💾 Data Storage Architecture Deep Dive

### Current Storage Implementation
**Documents are stored in:**
- **Vercel Blob** (default) - Vercel's managed file storage
- **AWS S3** (configurable) - Enterprise option via environment variables  
- **MinIO** (self-hosted S3-compatible) - Full self-hosted option

**Storage Flow:**
```
User uploads → Next.js API → Prisma processes → File storage + Database metadata
```

**Database stores:**
- File metadata, permissions, analytics
- **NOT the actual file content** (just references/URLs)

### Strategic Storage Opportunities

#### 1. **Hybrid Cloud Strategy**
- Keep sensitive docs **completely on-premises** (MinIO)
- Metadata in cloud database for speed/analytics
- **Pitch:** "Your documents never leave your infrastructure"

**Market Opportunity:** Government, finance, healthcare sectors with strict data residency requirements

#### 2. **Multi-Cloud Redundancy**
- Automatically replicate to multiple storage providers
- **Pitch:** "Enterprise-grade disaster recovery built-in"

**Technical Implementation:** Storage abstraction layer that can simultaneously write to multiple backends

#### 3. **Compliance Gold Mine**
- EU data sovereignty (store in EU S3 regions)
- HIPAA compliance (dedicated storage)
- **Pitch:** "Compliance-ready out of the box"

**Revenue Opportunity:** Compliance-as-a-service premium tiers

#### 4. **Edge Storage Network**
- Global CDN for document delivery
- **Pitch:** "Sub-second document access worldwide"

**Competitive Advantage:** Most dataroom platforms are slow globally

#### 5. **Storage Marketplace**
- Plugin architecture for storage providers
- **Pitch:** "Use any storage backend you want"

**Platform Play:** Create ecosystem of storage integrations

### Strategic Questions to Explore:

🤔 **Data Sovereignty:** Are enterprise customers asking about data location/control?

🤔 **Storage Costs:** What are the economics at scale (1TB+ per customer)?

🤔 **Performance:** How important is global document access speed?

🤔 **Compliance:** Which regulations create the biggest barriers to adoption?

🤔 **Hybrid Deployments:** Do customers want some cloud, some on-prem?

**Major Differentiator Potential:** Most competitors lock you into their storage. Deal Docs could be the **"bring your own storage"** dataroom platform.
